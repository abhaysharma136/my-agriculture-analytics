### How the logic works
## The YearTable component renders a table with three columns:

1. Year: The year of the data (extracted from strings like Financial Year (Apr - Mar), 1950).
2. Crop with Max Production: The crop with the highest production for that year.
3. Crop with Min Production: The crop with the lowest production for that year.
